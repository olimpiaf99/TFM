3,4,1, What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
6,7,1," Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . "
10,11,1," No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . "
12,13,1, So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . 
14,15,1," No , thank you . "
16,17,1, Shame on you ! 
18,19,1, That's not fair ! 
20,21,1, Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week ! 
26,27,1,I hate doing the damn laundry . 
31,32,6, No ! Are you kidding me ? 
33,34,1, I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . 
35,36,1," Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! "
39,40,1," Yes , you should have . "

106,107,1, Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . 
117,118,1, At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? 
119,120,1," There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! "
120,121,1,I'm going crazy . 
124,125,1,"Ann , it's terrible ! "
129,130,1, I think it's because of your bad habits ! 
132,133,6, I wasn't aware of that ! 
137,138,1," Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . "
139,140,1," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . "
144,145,1, I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . 
146,147,1, He is really outrageous . 
149,150,6, What ? He can't do this to you . 
150,151,1," Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . "
152,153,1, I shouted it back of course . 
156,157,1," No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . "
158,159,1, I am too angry to do that .

181,182,1," Oh , this one is perfect . "
188,189,1, That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . 
190,191,1," Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . "
196,197,1, Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane .

226,227,6, Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . 
234,235,1," Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . "
236,237,1, No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . 
240,241,1,How slowly you drive ! 
248,249,1," Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby ! "
262,263,1, Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think . 
265,266,1, It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves 
267,268,1," Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . "

288,289,1, But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
300,301,1, What ? You're overcharging me ! 
303,304,1,Ouch ! I'm hurt .

327,328,1," You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else ! "
328,329,1," Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! "
329,330,1, Just what gives you the right ... ? 
330,331,1," Because I'm no sucker  only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . "
333,334,1, Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day ! 
336,337,1," Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady ! "
337,338,1," Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah ! "
339,340,6, You're kidding . We'll never make it across in one piece ! Let's cross at the light . 
341,342,1," If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters ! "
351,352,1, Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . 
357,358,1," Listen , I know who you are . If you call this number again , I ’ ll call the police . You ’ ll be arrested . I ’ Ve got your number . "
376,377,1," Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? "
384,385,1, I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . 
392,393,1," I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . "
394,395,1," It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . "
404,405,1,Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . 
406,407,1," My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . "
408,409,1,My stomach's growling again ! 
427,428,1," Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! "
431,432,1,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! 
432,433,1," If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! "
433,434,1, He sounds like a sick cow ! 
447,448,1, That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! 
453,454,1," Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . "
466,467,1," Oh , yes . I get six Korean channels but nothing in English ! "
467,468,1,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
469,470,1," yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . "
471,472,1, but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 
479,480,1, Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . 
486,487,1," Look , traffic jam again ! "
489,490,1, It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school .

503,504,1,What a terrible house ! 
505,506,1," The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking "
506,507,1," There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! "
507,508,1," It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! "
508,509,1,I'll be late because I have waited so long ! 
515,516,1, We have to wait six more minutes ! 
518,519,1," Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . "
537,538,1, You said you were only going to window shop ! 
538,539,1," I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! "
547,548,1," First I was late for school this morning , and now I broke your vase . This isn't my day ! "
552,553,1," Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! "
556,557,1,Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible ! 
560,561,1,"Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . "
567,568,1,I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . 
572,573,1,"Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . "
573,574,1, Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . 
574,575,1, I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . 
575,576,1, Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! 
576,577,1," Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . "

580,581,1, Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign . 
589,590,1," I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! "
591,592,1," Oh , yes , I would ! "
596,597,1, You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
600,601,1," Oh , don't you ? God save me ! "
608,609,1, You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
610,611,1, Who knows ! That might come to later . 
618,619,1, Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
623,624,1," At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? "
625,626,1," But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? "
627,628,1," But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? "

680,681,1,"What a mess , Jack ! "

692,693,1, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
703,704,1," Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! "
711,712,1,"Oh , come on , Ultraman ! "
716,717,1," Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! "

759,760,1,What a terrible house ! 
761,762,1," The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . "
766,767,1, I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . 
770,771,1, It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . 
778,779,1," You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . "
779,780,6, Where ? my car ? 
780,781,1," No , mine ! "
792,793,1, I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .

802,803,1, Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . 
806,807,1,"Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! "
816,817,6, What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
820,821,1, I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 
821,822,1," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! "
822,823,6,"I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . "

851,852,1," That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . "
852,853,1," I don't need your help , jerk . "
859,860,1," Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . "

902,903,1," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! "

958,959,6, What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !

971,972,1," Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . "
974,975,1,Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
975,976,1," I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! "
976,977,1, Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
987,988,1," Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! "
990,991,1, Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday . 
994,995,1, Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .

1021,1022,1, I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! 
1025,1026,1," Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . "
1029,1030,1, I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! 
1031,1032,1," Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! "
1033,1034,6,"Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . "
1035,1036,1," You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! "
1037,1038,1, You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! 
1039,1040,1, And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! 
1049,1050,1, Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . 
1051,1052,6, What ? I sent you three or four messages ! 
1053,1054,1, Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . 
1055,1056,6, I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? 
1059,1060,1," I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . "
1074,1075,1, Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! 
1076,1077,1, Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
1077,1078,1," What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... "
1078,1079,1, Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
1084,1085,1, It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
1088,1089,1, Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
1090,1091,1,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
1091,1092,1, Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
1093,1094,1," I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! "
1100,1101,1,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 
1102,1103,1," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . "
1103,1104,1," Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . "
1106,1107,1,I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! 
1114,1115,1, Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
1115,1116,6," Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! "
1116,1117,1, Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
1117,1118,1, Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
1118,1119,1," When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! "
1120,1121,1, I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
1122,1123,6, What ’ s wrong ? 
1137,1138,1," Get out of my store , you jerk ! "
1141,1142,1," All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! "
1143,1144,1, Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
1149,1150,1, What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
1151,1152,1, My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
1155,1156,1, Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
1163,1164,1," Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! "
1178,1179,6, Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
1180,1181,1," Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! "
1182,1183,1," Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . "
1185,1186,6, Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
1187,1188,1, Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
1191,1192,6," Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! "
1197,1198,1, Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
1201,1202,1,"Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . "
1203,1204,1, You should at least give me a call . 
1205,1206,1,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! 
1206,1207,1," If I hear "" Love Me Tender "" one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! "
1211,1212,1,Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! 
1212,1213,6, What ! 
1214,1215,6, It's my new radio earphone . 
1217,1218,1,Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! 
1225,1226,1, You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
1226,1227,1," Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! "
1230,1231,6, What ! 
1232,1233,1, Don't you dare tell me that ... 
1234,1235,1," Well , they should have called you ! "
1236,1237,1, And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 
1238,1239,1, It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! 
1240,1241,1, Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! 
1242,1243,1,"Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting my main dish for quite a time . "
1253,1254,1, It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! 
1257,1258,1, We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? 
1264,1265,6, Really ? Let ’ s go there . 
1267,1268,1, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
1268,1269,1, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
1269,1270,1, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
1276,1277,1, But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . 
1283,1284,1,"Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway . "
1297,1298,6, You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered . 
1303,1304,1," I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! "
1305,1306,6," Oh , my bread ! "
1307,1308,1, Curse this oven ! Curse it ! 
1309,1310,1, Curse the worst oven in the world . 
1316,1317,6," Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ? "
1318,1319,1, I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then . 
1332,1333,1," Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain . "
1335,1336,1,"Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . "
1345,1346,6," Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow to the breathalyzer , please . "
1352,1353,1," Oh , no ! "
1359,1360,1, But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! 
1372,1373,1, Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
1374,1375,1, Fine ! What do you need ? 
1380,1381,1,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
1394,1395,1, Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri . 
1400,1401,6," Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq "
1401,1402,1, Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
1402,1403,1," What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... "
1403,1404,1, Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
1404,1405,1,Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
1416,1417,6," Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! "
1417,1418,1, Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
1418,1419,1, Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
1428,1429,6," I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? "
1430,1431,1," Get out of my store , you jerk ! "
1433,1434,6, What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
1438,1439,1," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! "
1439,1440,1,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
1442,1443,6, Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
1451,1452,1," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . "
1461,1462,1, Damn ! 
1467,1468,1, Mom ! That is so unfair ! 
1469,1470,6, What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding ! 
1470,1471,1, I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! 
1472,1473,1, Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
1477,1478,1,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
1487,1488,1,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . "
1495,1496,6, Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
1497,1498,1," Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . "
1505,1506,6," Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . "
1506,1507,1, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
1510,1511,1, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
1512,1513,1, To hell with you . 
1519,1520,1," Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . "
1520,1521,6,"Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? "
1529,1530,1, I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
1544,1545,1," I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! "
1557,1558,1," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! "
1563,1564,1, That ’ s so unfair ! 
1566,1567,1, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
1567,1568,1, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
1568,1569,1, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
1573,1574,1, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
1577,1578,1, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
1579,1580,1, To hell with you . 
1580,1581,1,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
1582,1583,1, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
1596,1597,6, Days ? 
1601,1602,1,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
1604,1605,6, Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
1605,1606,1," No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . "
1613,1614,1," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . "
1623,1624,1, Damn ! 
1632,1633,1, Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . 
1642,1643,1," Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! "
1649,1650,1,"Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! "
1653,1654,1, But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . 
1658,1659,1,Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? 
1662,1663,1,this bloody computer ! 
1664,1665,1, my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! 
1668,1669,1," oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . "
1695,1696,1," yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! "
1708,1709,1," Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . "
1726,1727,6, Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . 
1750,1751,1," Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? "
1758,1759,1, that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? 
1767,1768,1,Do you have any idea what time it is ? 
1775,1776,1," If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . "
1776,1777,6, You're going to kick me out over this ? 
1778,1779,1," Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules . "
1779,1780,1,Do you know how late it is ? 
1783,1784,1, Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? 
1787,1788,1," Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . "
1788,1789,6, You want to throw me out over this ? 
1790,1791,1," That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter . "
1791,1792,1,I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . 
1806,1807,1, I can't stand riding the bus . 
1807,1808,1," Me too , it's so unreliable . "
1809,1810,1, It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . 
1810,1811,1, Exactly.That ' s the worst part . 
1818,1819,1, I really do hate public transportation . 
1819,1820,1," I agree , it's just never on time . "
1821,1822,1, I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather . 
1822,1823,1," Oh , that's the worst . "
1827,1828,1, There ’ s no way that I can stay here . 
1829,1830,6, I don ’ t understand why . 
1835,1836,1, But I ’ m not able to live here anymore . 
1839,1840,6, Are you kidding me ? 
1841,1842,1, You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! 
1854,1855,1, Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! 
1864,1865,1, I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! 
1866,1867,1, You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! 
1876,1877,1, You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal ! 
1877,1878,1,"Emily , what kind of report is this ? "
1879,1880,1," Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . "
1883,1884,1, Just get out of my face ! 
1885,1886,1, Leave me alone ! 
1890,1891,6, You've got to be joking . 
1894,1895,1, Don't brother me ! 
1899,1900,6, No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
1903,1904,6," You can't do that , Jenny ! "
1907,1908,1, Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . 
1909,1910,1," Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . "
1911,1912,1, You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . 
1913,1914,1, If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . 
1920,1921,1, I am very grateful for your advice . 
1921,1922,1, It's my pleasure to talk with you . 
1925,1926,1, Just get out of my face ! 
1927,1928,1, Leave me alone ! 
1932,1933,6, You've got be joking . 
1936,1937,1, Don't brother me ! 
1941,1942,6, No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
1953,1954,1, Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . 
1968,1969,1," Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! "
1969,1970,1,I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 
1971,1972,1,My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . 
1973,1974,1, Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . 
1974,1975,6,The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! 
1975,1976,1, I really want to take him over my knee . 
1981,1982,1," Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! "
1986,1987,1, That ’ s too much . 
1992,1993,1, I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . 
1994,1995,1, You should feel shameful for your behavior . 
1997,1998,1,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
2007,2008,1," I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? "
2008,2009,1, And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . 
2009,2010,1,Joan is a thorough drag ! 
2013,2014,1,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
2015,2016,1, You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
2021,2022,1, She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 
2023,2024,1,I have a bone to pick with you . 
2025,2026,1, You always have a chip on your shoulder . 
2028,2029,1, He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
2031,2032,1, How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
2036,2037,1," Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . "
2037,2038,1,I ’ m itching for moving ! 
2039,2040,1," It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . "
2040,2041,1,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
2042,2043,1, So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
2043,2044,6, Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
2052,2053,1," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . "
2054,2055,1,"Bob , I'm really upset with you . "
2056,2057,1, You forgot it last year as well . 
2059,2060,1, It is impossible . You cheated on me . 
2061,2062,1, Shut up ! 
2063,2064,1," But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . "
2065,2066,1, Leave me ! Go away ! 
2066,2067,1,How could you have done that without asking me first ? 
2072,2073,1," Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? "
2074,2075,1, I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! 
2076,2077,1, No way ! Please don't follow me around . 
2079,2080,1,I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . 
2083,2084,1,I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
2085,2086,1, What did you think you were doing ? 
2087,2088,1, How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
2094,2095,6, Didn't I ? 
2099,2100,1, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
2101,2102,1," Oh , you men ! You are all the same . "
2106,2107,1, Just what I thought ! 
2108,2109,1," Just get out of my face , would you ? "
2112,2113,1, Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? 
2114,2115,1, Get out of here ! 
2116,2117,1," Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! "
2118,2119,1, You ! 
2120,2121,1, You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? 
2126,2127,1, Don't bother . 
2130,2131,1, Waiter ! 
2134,2135,1," I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . "
2136,2137,1,You ’ re making my blood boil . 
2138,2139,1, I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . 
2140,2141,1, Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? 
2142,2143,1," Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! "
2144,2145,1,Look what you've done ! 
2146,2147,1," Yes , and hurry up ! "
2152,2153,1," Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! "
2163,2164,1, That's crossing the line . 
2168,2169,1," Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . "
2169,2170,1," Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . "
2171,2172,1, I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! 
2173,2174,1, Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
2175,2176,1," Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! "
2177,2178,1, Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
2181,2182,1,I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? 
2183,2184,1, It's really very easy saying you're sorry . 
2185,2186,1,You didn't tell me she was married ! 
2187,2188,1, I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! 
2193,2194,1,"Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! "
2195,2196,1, No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! 
2199,2200,1, Copycat ! 
2201,2202,1," You went out and bought khakis , too ! "
2206,2207,1, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
2208,2209,1, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
2212,2213,1, The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
2213,2214,1, Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
2214,2215,1," I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? "
2215,2216,1, You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
2216,2217,1," Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . "
2217,2218,1, Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 
2219,2220,1,It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
2221,2222,1, What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
2223,2224,1," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . "
2225,2226,1, Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
2227,2228,1, I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
2229,2230,1, Why not ? 
2231,2232,1," The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . "
2235,2236,1,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
2237,2238,1, You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
2239,2240,1,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
2247,2248,1, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
2249,2250,1," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
2251,2252,1, Stay away from me . 
2253,2254,1," I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . "
2255,2256,1, Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . 
2259,2260,6, What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 
2261,2262,1, Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! 
2262,2263,6,what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
2264,2265,1, How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
2268,2269,1,You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . 
2270,2271,1, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
2271,2272,6," Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . "
2272,2273,1, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
2277,2278,6, Why ? 
2279,2280,1, It is stupid to say so . 
2281,2282,1, How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
2285,2286,1," Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? "
2287,2288,1, Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
2289,2290,1, Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
2291,2292,1, It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
2292,2293,1,They promised us a sea view . 
2294,2295,1, Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 
2297,2298,1, I don ’ t want to . 
2299,2300,1, Certainly not . 
2301,2302,1, Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
2303,2304,1, Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
2305,2306,1," To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . "
2306,2307,1,It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
2307,2308,6, Really ? There aren't many left now . 
2311,2312,1,You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
2312,2313,1, Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
2313,2314,1," They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . "
2314,2315,1, They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
2315,2316,1, You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
2316,2317,1, Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
2317,2318,1," They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . "
2318,2319,1, They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
2319,2320,1, You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
2320,2321,1, Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
2321,2322,1," They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . "
2322,2323,1, They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
2328,2329,1, His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . 
2329,2330,1,Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? 
2330,2331,1," Yeah , I'm afraid so . "
2331,2332,1," If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . "
2332,2333,1," Yes , it is annoying . "
2333,2334,1,"I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time "
2335,2336,1, Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? 
2337,2338,1,Did you hear what she said to me ? 
2339,2340,1, What do you think I should do about it ? 
2347,2348,1," Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . "
2348,2349,1," Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? "
2349,2350,1,Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? 
2363,2364,1," You don ’ t love me , Roy . "
2365,2366,1," No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . "
2367,2368,1, I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . 
2369,2370,1," Oh , shut up , Roy . "
2371,2372,1," Oh , SHUT UP ! "
2373,2374,1, But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
2375,2376,1, I don't care . 
2377,2378,1," You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . "
2378,2379,6, How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? 
2379,2380,1, He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . 
2381,2382,6, You think he might stay even longer ? ! 
2383,2384,1, That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 
2384,2385,1,How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? 
2387,2388,1," Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . "
2389,2390,1," why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? "
2391,2392,1, Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? 
2395,2396,1, Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . 
2397,2398,1, Are you done ? 
2398,2399,1,"Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? "
2400,2401,1, Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . 
2405,2406,1,I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
2407,2408,1, What did you think you were doing ? 
2409,2410,1, How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
2414,2415,1, I don't want to . 
2416,2417,1, Certainly not . 
2418,2419,1, Turn on the TV for what ? 
2420,2421,1," Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? "
2423,2424,1,Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . 
2426,2427,1, It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . 
2428,2429,1, What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . 
2432,2433,1, That's absolutely ridiculous ! 
2433,2434,1,I hate to see the abuse of animals . 
2434,2435,1, It makes me sick . 
2435,2436,1,"I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! "
2442,2443,6," What ? Are you serious ? Oh , my gosh ! There will be guys everywhere . "
2443,2444,1,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
2445,2446,1, But you should tell me you were in love with her . 
2447,2448,1, You know you didn't . 
2449,2450,1," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
2451,2452,1, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
2453,2454,1," Oh , you men ! You are all the same . "
2455,2456,1," How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . "
2456,2457,1," It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . "
2457,2458,1," Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . "
2460,2461,6, Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! 
2465,2466,6," What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . "
2467,2468,1, That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? 
2469,2470,1, it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! 
2470,2471,1,Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! 
2472,2473,6, Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! 
2474,2475,1," Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! "
2479,2480,1, And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! 
2486,2487,1," But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . "
2496,2497,1, Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . 
2500,2501,1," Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . "
2501,2502,1,What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
2504,2505,1,What a terrible house ! 
2506,2507,1," The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! "
2511,2512,1, Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! 
2515,2516,1, We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! 
2518,2519,1," You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . "
2519,2520,1,I'll never ever work together with him ! 
2521,2522,1, Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! 
2526,2527,1, What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
2530,2531,6, What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
2532,2533,1, I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
2534,2535,1," To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! "
2536,2537,1," Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! "
2538,2539,1," There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . "
2540,2541,1," He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! "
2542,2543,1, I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
2548,2549,1,I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! 
2550,2551,1, They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! 
2552,2553,1," I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! "
2554,2555,1, They both just talk about how great they are all the time . 
2555,2556,1, They soud like the neighbours from hell ! 
2556,2557,1," They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . "
2572,2573,1, That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? 
2587,2588,1, my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! 
2589,2590,1, you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! 
2591,2592,6, really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy . 
2598,2599,1,It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
2600,2601,1, What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
2602,2603,1," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . "
2604,2605,1, Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
2609,2610,1, But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . 
2611,2612,1," I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . "
2613,2614,1, Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . 
2615,2616,1," Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . "
2616,2617,1,Look at what you have done . All thumbs . 
2618,2619,1,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
2620,2621,1, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
2627,2628,6, I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
2631,2632,6, But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
2639,2640,6," What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! "
2641,2642,1, For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? 
2643,2644,6, What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? 
2645,2646,6, Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! 
2647,2648,1, We ’ re doomed ! 
2649,2650,6, Really ? What ! 
2656,2657,6, What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? 
2658,2659,1," What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! "
2660,2661,1, I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! 
2662,2663,1,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long 
2664,2665,1," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . "
2669,2670,1, My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
2686,2687,6, What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
2688,2689,6, What ! I resent that ! 
2689,2690,1," Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! "
2690,2691,1,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
2691,2692,6, What ? What did you buy ? 
2692,2693,1, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
2709,2710,1,I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
2711,2712,1," That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! "
2713,2714,1," Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? "
2732,2733,1, I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
2738,2739,1, Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
2740,2741,1, You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
2749,2750,1," You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore "
2753,2754,1," Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours  they ’ re no saints . "
2755,2756,1," You ’ re unbearable  you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . "
2756,2757,6,I can ’ t believe it ! 
2758,2759,1," Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! "
2760,2761,1, I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
2762,2763,1," 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! "
2764,2765,1,I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! 
2765,2766,1, Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! 
2766,2767,1,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
2767,2768,6, What ? What did you buy ? 
2768,2769,1, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
2770,2771,1," There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . "
2775,2776,6, I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
2793,2794,1, You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
2794,2795,1,It's taking you forever to do my hair . 
2796,2797,1, You should've been done already . 
2798,2799,1, I don't think that you're done . 
2800,2801,1, My hair looks hideous . 
2802,2803,1, It doesn't look good at all . 
2804,2805,1, I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . 
2806,2807,1,You're spending a very long time on my hair . 
2810,2811,1, Are you sure you're finished ? 
2812,2813,1, You did a horrible job on my hair . 
2828,2829,1, I won't be paying you for this . 
2830,2831,1,I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . 
2833,2834,1," Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . "
2840,2841,1,"This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . "
2842,2843,1, No way . I've given you too many chances already . 
2843,2844,1,How annoying ! 
2854,2855,1, But how guilty to waste food ! 
2855,2856,1,You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! 
2857,2858,1, Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . 
2859,2860,6, You're serious ? 
2864,2865,1," Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? "
2866,2867,1, Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . 
2868,2869,1, Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! 
2870,2871,1," It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! "
2871,2872,6, Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? 
2872,2873,1," No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! "
2874,2875,1," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . "
2876,2877,1, I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . 
2880,2881,1,I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . 
2882,2883,1, How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . 
2885,2886,1, Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . 
2886,2887,1,Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? 
2888,2889,1," Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . "
2890,2891,1," Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! "
2891,2892,1,I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . 
2893,2894,1, How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . 
2896,2897,1, For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? 
2898,2899,1, You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . 
2900,2901,1," Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? "
2903,2904,1," But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . "
2905,2906,1," But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? "
2907,2908,1, But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? 
2911,2912,1," No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . "
2912,2913,1, I tell you I must go ! 
2915,2916,1, I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . 
2916,2917,1, I'll never again come to your side  I am turn away now and can't return . 
2917,2918,1,I really like the record you lent me the other day . 
2918,2919,1, I'm glad you like it . 
2919,2920,1, And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
2920,2921,1, Not at all . 
2921,2922,1, I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . 
2922,2923,1, I'm glad . 
2924,2925,1,Congratulations on the new house ! 
2925,2926,1, Thanks ! We love it . 
2926,2927,1," Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . "
2933,2934,1, Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? 
2935,2936,6, All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . 
2939,2940,1, I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
2966,2967,1," The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! "
2970,2971,1, It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
2972,2973,1,"I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? "
2974,2975,1, I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! 
2981,2982,6," Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . "
2983,2984,1," No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? "
2985,2986,1," You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these "" big days "" , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . "
2993,2994,1,"Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! "
2998,2999,1, Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! 
3000,3001,1," It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! "
3001,3002,6, Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? 
3002,3003,1," No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! "
3004,3005,1," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . "
3005,3006,1, I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! 
3006,3007,1, I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . 
3013,3014,1," With everything , with everybody , with all this ! "
3021,3022,1," The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . "
3023,3024,1, I'll beat him . 
3026,3027,1, I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
3027,3028,1, How dare you speak to me like this . 
3028,3029,1, Why not ? 
3029,3030,1,When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
3033,3034,1, I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
3035,3036,1, I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
3036,3037,1,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . "
3038,3039,1, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
3040,3041,1, What a bummer ! You set me up ? 
3042,3043,1, How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) 
3044,3045,1, Why did you lie to me in the email ? 
3046,3047,1, I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . 
3054,3055,1," Ur , you really let me down . "
3056,3057,1," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
3059,3060,6,What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
3061,3062,1, How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
3063,3064,1, I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 
3065,3066,1,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
3067,3068,1, But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
3069,3070,1, You know you didn't . 
3071,3072,1," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
3073,3074,1, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
3075,3076,1," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
3076,3077,1,Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
3078,3079,1, There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
3086,3087,1, It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
3088,3089,1, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
3090,3091,1, It really hurts . 
3092,3093,1, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
3094,3095,1, To hell with you . 
3098,3099,1, Quiet everybody ! 
3099,3100,1,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! 
3101,3102,1, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
3103,3104,1," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . "
3109,3110,1,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
3111,3112,1, But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
3113,3114,1, You know you didn't . 
3115,3116,1," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
3117,3118,1, You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
3119,3120,1," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
3120,3121,1,You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? 
3122,3123,1, You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . 
3124,3125,1," It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? "
3135,3136,1, Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
3144,3145,1," Ur , you really let me down . "
3146,3147,1," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
3156,3157,1," And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! "
3157,3158,1, Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
3158,3159,1, Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
3159,3160,1," Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! "
3160,3161,1," Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? "
3161,3162,1, I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
3168,3169,1," I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! "
3169,3170,1," He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! "
3180,3181,1," Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! "
3183,3184,6, A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
3194,3195,6," What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! "
3199,3200,1," This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! "
3207,3208,1," Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . "
3211,3212,1, I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! 
3218,3219,1," You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! "
3224,3225,1,"I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . "
3226,3227,1, You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . 
3231,3232,1,"So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . "
3233,3234,1," Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! "
3235,3236,1," What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? "
3238,3239,1,"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . "
3240,3241,1," I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . "
3247,3248,1, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
3249,3250,1, what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
3251,3252,1,I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . 
3253,3254,1, How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! 
3261,3262,6," Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . "
3262,3263,1," What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . "
3264,3265,1, But she lied to me . 
3277,3278,1," Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . "
3285,3286,1, We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . 
3290,3291,1, What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . 
3296,3297,6," It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? "
3301,3302,1, What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
3303,3304,1,I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . 
3309,3310,1, No ! ! ! 
3318,3319,1," I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! "
3319,3320,1," He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! "
3333,3334,1," No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin "
3335,3336,1," I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . "
3337,3338,1, Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . 
3344,3345,1, Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 
3347,3348,6, What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
3349,3350,1," I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! "
3351,3352,1," That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! "
3352,3353,1,Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
3353,3354,1," I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! "
3359,3360,1,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
3361,3362,1, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
3375,3376,6, Days ? 
3382,3383,1," You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? "
3392,3393,1," to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . "
3394,3395,1," well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . "
3396,3397,1," the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . "
3398,3399,1, a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . 
3407,3408,1," No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . "
3422,3423,1," you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! "
3438,3439,6, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
3440,3441,1, what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
3442,3443,1, how dare you ! 
3449,3450,1, It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . 
3451,3452,1, She made another white crack about my clothes . 
3462,3463,6,not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! 
3466,3467,1, addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
3480,3481,1," Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! "
3482,3483,1," Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . "
3490,3491,1, Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? 
3492,3493,1, Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! 
3494,3495,1,Could you please stop flipping the channels ? 
3496,3497,1,"May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . "
3498,3499,1,Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . 
3499,3500,1, I dare you to say that again . 
3501,3502,1, Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 
3502,3503,1,Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? 
3505,3506,1, Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . 
3518,3519,1, it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . 
3520,3521,1,the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
3522,3523,1," on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . "
3533,3534,1,We are through . 
3534,3535,6, Why ? 
3535,3536,1," Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . "
3537,3538,1," But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . "
3539,3540,1, You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . 
3541,3542,1, I don't buy a story . 
3543,3544,1," No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . "
3544,3545,1,I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . 
3546,3547,1," How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . "
3548,3549,1, It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . 
3550,3551,1, Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . 
3552,3553,1, I just don't trust you any more . 
3556,3557,6," I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? "
3558,3559,1," Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? "
3571,3572,1, Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . 
3574,3575,1, Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? 
3576,3577,1, Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . 
3579,3580,1, Don't be nosey . 
3582,3583,1, That's harsh . 
3586,3587,1, Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? 
3588,3589,1, I wasn't done talking to you . 
3589,3590,1," I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . "
3591,3592,1, I really don't think it's any of your business . 
3592,3593,1, That's not nice . 
3597,3598,6, What are you talking about ? 
3598,3599,1, What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? 
3599,3600,1," You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! "
3600,3601,1, Really ? Who made that rule up ? 
3601,3602,1," With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . "
3602,3603,1, That works for me ! 
3605,3606,1, Are you kidding me ? 
3606,3607,1," You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? "
3607,3608,1," We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . "
3608,3609,1, I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? 
3609,3610,1," Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! "
3610,3611,1, I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! 
3613,3614,1, You can't be serious ! 
3614,3615,1," Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . "
3615,3616,1," After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . "
3616,3617,1, Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . 
3617,3618,1," You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! "
3618,3619,1, Whatever you say ! 
3630,3631,1, See you . 
3631,3632,1,Excuse me . This chicken doesn't taste right to me . 
3633,3634,1, How should I know ? It's just kind of cold in the middle . It just doesn't taste right . Do you want to try it ? 
3638,3639,1,Excuse me . Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here ? I would like to make a few complaints . 
3640,3641,1," Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room . "
3649,3650,1, Isn't that a bit excessive ? 
3654,3655,1," Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . "
3662,3663,1,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? 
3664,3665,1, You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? 
3671,3672,1," Oh , how annoying ! "
3673,3674,1, Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five . 
3675,3676,1," Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots . "
3677,3678,1, But have 2 - hour journey . 
3680,3681,1, I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . 
3688,3689,1, I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now . 
3693,3694,1, Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing . 
3697,3698,1, This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . 
3702,3703,1,I have a complaint to make . I've just been badly treated by a rude maid . 
3707,3708,1," Oh , how annoying ! "
3709,3710,1, What a nuisance ! 
3710,3711,1,Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
3723,3724,1," What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! "
3725,3726,1," Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . "
3727,3728,1, That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
3734,3735,1, Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? 
3736,3737,1, Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? 
3738,3739,1,"My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . "
3740,3741,1, That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . 
3744,3745,1, Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? 
3746,3747,1, This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! 
3748,3749,1,You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw . 
3750,3751,1," Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . "
3754,3755,1, Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? 
3756,3757,1, This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police ! 
3758,3759,1,I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
3760,3761,1, That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . 
3766,3767,1, Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . 
3768,3769,1,Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? 
3774,3775,1, You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! 
3776,3777,1," Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! "
3792,3793,1," Oh , honey ! Don ’ t you remember this important day to us ? "
3810,3811,1," No , we got no receipt , but we paid on the spot . "
3822,3823,1," Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . "
3824,3825,1, That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . 
3832,3833,1," No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot ! "
3847,3848,1," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
3855,3856,1, How dare you question my statement ! 
3863,3864,1, There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! 
3871,3872,1, You dare to doubt me ? 
3879,3880,1, I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! 
3887,3888,1, Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . 
3895,3896,1, You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! 
3899,3900,1, I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! 
3905,3906,1, I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! 
3909,3910,1,"This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . "
3911,3912,1," In a word , cockroaches ! "
3915,3916,1,"I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! "
3917,3918,1, Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! 
3935,3936,1," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
3948,3949,1," I can wait , but my toothache can't ! "
3963,3964,1," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
3979,3980,1, Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
3982,3983,1, I've had enough . 
3990,3991,1," Give me a break , Mr Yang . "
3997,3998,1," But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . "
4004,4005,1," Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly . "
4006,4007,1," Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ? "
4014,4015,1, I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . 
4016,4017,1," I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . "
4019,4020,1, It certainly didn't arrive here that way . 
4030,4031,1," Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! "
4034,4035,1," He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! "
4036,4037,1, I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
4042,4043,1,"Gordon , you're ever so late . "
4044,4045,1," But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . "
4046,4047,1, How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
4048,4049,1," Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? "
4054,4055,1, I am not convinced by your explanation . 
4055,4056,1,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . 
4057,4058,1, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
4059,4060,1," I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . "
4073,4074,1, Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . 
4075,4076,1, You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? 
4083,4084,6, Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? 
4086,4087,1, I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . 
4094,4095,1, I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . 
4099,4100,1, Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
4101,4102,1, How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
4112,4113,6, Why ? I work very hard . 
4116,4117,1, It's unfair . 
4125,4126,6," Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . "
4128,4129,1, I got the message . I'm quiting . 
4130,4131,1," I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . "
4132,4133,1," Very well , consider me gone . "
4133,4134,1,We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
4137,4138,1,What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
4139,4140,1," Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . "
4149,4150,1, His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! 
4156,4157,6, What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
4158,4159,1, What ! I resent that ! 
4164,4165,1," Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! "
4170,4171,1, You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
4172,4173,1, I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
4174,4175,1," I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
4175,4176,1,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . "
4182,4183,1,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! 
4184,4185,1, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
4186,4187,1," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . "
4188,4189,1," Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . "
4196,4197,1, You said the same thing three months ago . 
4197,4198,6," Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . "
4206,4207,1," Mike , you're late again . "
4208,4209,1, Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
4210,4211,1, How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
4215,4216,1,How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
4223,4224,1," You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . "
4225,4226,1, You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! 
4226,4227,1,"And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . "
4228,4229,1," Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . "
4230,4231,1," I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! "
4234,4235,6, Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? 
4237,4238,1," But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . "
4239,4240,1," Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . "
4242,4243,1, You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
4244,4245,1, I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
4246,4247,1," I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
4251,4252,1, Come on ! What have you got to lose ? 
4257,4258,1, You said the same thing three months ago . 
4259,4260,1, You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? 
4261,4262,1, I got the message . I am quitting . 
4268,4269,1, Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? 
4269,4270,1," What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . "
4274,4275,1," I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . "
4276,4277,1,"Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . "
4282,4283,1, I ’ d like to know why you ’ re always taking credit for work we ’ Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad ? 
4283,4284,1," That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . "
4284,4285,1,I have to talk to you ! 
4285,4286,6," What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! "
4286,4287,1," I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . "
4288,4289,1,Susan ! Why didn ’ t you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account ? 
4290,4291,1, You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half . 
4292,4293,1,The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
4298,4299,1, No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? 
4300,4301,1, You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! 
4308,4309,6, Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? 
4310,4311,6," No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . "
4314,4315,1," I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! "
4321,4322,1," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! "
4323,4324,1," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . "
4325,4326,1," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
4328,4329,1," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! "
4330,4331,1," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . "
4332,4333,1," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
4335,4336,1, What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
4339,4340,1, I didn't do anything . 
4341,4342,1," No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . "
4343,4344,1," I don't need your help , jerk . "
4345,4346,1,"John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . "
4347,4348,1," That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! "
4352,4353,1, You ’ re a liar ! 
4367,4368,6, Are you serious ? 
4368,4369,1, I ’ m not kidding . 
4373,4374,1,Why am I being arrested ? 
4375,4376,1, I don't have a warrant . 
4377,4378,1, I don't know what a bench warrant is . 
4379,4380,1, I was never told to go to court . 
4381,4382,1, This isn't fair . 
4383,4384,1, What about my rights ? 
4385,4386,1,I don't understand why I'm being arrested . 
4387,4388,1, A warrant for what ? 
4389,4390,1, What does that mean ? 
4391,4392,1, I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . 
4393,4394,1, I don't find this fair . 
4395,4396,1, Don't I have any rights ? 
4397,4398,1,Why are you arresting me ? 
4399,4400,1, What kind of warrant ? 
4401,4402,1, What is that ? 
4403,4404,1, I never went to court . 
4405,4406,1, This is unfair . 
4407,4408,1," I have rights , don't I ? "
4410,4411,1, I need to file a complaint . 
4412,4413,1, I got robbed . 
4422,4423,1, I want to file a complaint . 
4424,4425,1, A man robbed me today . 
4434,4435,1, I would like to file a complaint . 
4436,4437,1, I was robbed . 
4446,4447,1, They arrested me without probable cause . 
4448,4449,1, They had no reason for arresting me . 
4456,4457,1, I want justice . 
4458,4459,1, They arrested me for nothing . 
4460,4461,1, They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . 
4462,4463,1, They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . 
4464,4465,1, They sure did . 
4468,4469,1, I want to take them to court . 
4470,4471,1, I want to take them to court for arresting me . 
4472,4473,1, There was no reason for them to arrest me . 
4474,4475,1, They released me the next morning . 
4476,4477,1, That ’ s exactly what they did . 
4480,4481,1, I ’ m definitely taking them to court . 
4481,4482,1,"I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . "
4483,4484,1, It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . 
4485,4486,1," I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . "
4489,4490,1,"Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... "
4491,4492,1," I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... "
4493,4494,1," Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! "
4495,4496,1," No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! "
4502,4503,6," Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before . "
4597,4598,6,My goodness ! My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ? 
4775,4776,6, Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there . 
4831,4832,6, You can't be serious . 
4867,4868,6, Not back home for dinner again ? That's the third time this week ! 
5095,5096,6, You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . 
5161,5162,6," Oh , Madam , buy what ? "
5251,5252,6," Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ? "
5298,5299,6, Oh dear ! That's terrible ! What was in your wallet ? 
5635,5636,6, Oh really what ’ s happening ? 
5701,5702,6," Oh , dear ! "
5792,5793,6, Look ! The iron is still on . 
5903,5904,6," Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ? "
5936,5937,6,Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled ! 
5946,5947,6," Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no ! "
5964,5965,6," Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space ! "
5985,5986,6, Yes ! How do you know that ? 
6003,6004,6," Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . "
6022,6023,6, Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
6024,6025,6, My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? 
6058,6059,6," Oh , no ! Did you call the police ? "
6083,6084,6, Really ? You are so kind . 
6123,6124,6," I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! "
6125,6126,6, Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . 
6165,6166,6," Oh , dear ! "
6254,6255,6, Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? 
6264,6265,6, You can't be serious . 
6293,6294,6, What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ... 
6412,6413,6," What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss . "
6429,6430,6," Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup . "
6520,6521,6," Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here . "
6544,6545,6, What ? 
6585,6586,6," Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning . "
6636,6637,6, We have an appointment in half an hour . 
6837,6838,6, This is a Porsche ! 
6877,6878,6," Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ? "
6896,6897,6, Couldn't get connection ? 
6898,6899,6, Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right . 
6933,6934,6, But my sister bought this pair last month . 
6958,6959,6, What ? Are you serious ? 
6960,6961,6, But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
7016,7017,6, I did ? 
7052,7053,6, Did I really ? 
7053,7054,6, You didn't know ? 
7080,7081,6, What was he doing ? 
7092,7093,6, Exactly what did he do ? 
7104,7105,6, What do you mean ? 
7152,7153,6, Are you serious ? 
7164,7165,6, Seriously ? 
7176,7177,6, Really ? 
7241,7242,6, I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . 
7274,7275,6, Really ! 
7299,7300,6, Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . 
7347,7348,6, Why ? What happened ? 
7348,7349,6," Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . "
7437,7438,6," Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? "
7459,7460,6," But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! "
7515,7516,6, So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ? 
7525,7526,6, Why ? 
7537,7538,6, how could it be ? 
7559,7560,6, You can ’ t be serious ! 
7568,7569,6," Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . "
7751,7752,6," Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? "
7802,7803,6," Oh , no . "
7934,7935,6, You've been through this too ? 
7987,7988,6, Are you serious ? 
7989,7990,6, But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
8077,8078,6, A car door ? You mean just one car door ? 
8100,8101,6," What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . "
8113,8114,6," Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ? "
8135,8136,6, Really ? What happened ? 
8150,8151,6," Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? "
8199,8200,6, Really ? What's the matter ? 
8239,8240,6, Are you serious ? 
8241,8242,6, But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
8265,8266,6, Really ? Is he married ? 
8284,8285,6, Oh really ? Is he all right ? 
8329,8330,6," What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? "
8331,8332,6," So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? "
8359,8360,6," Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . "
8418,8419,6, That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 
8420,8421,6, I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years .
